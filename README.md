# Relationship between two data using linear regression

An analysis to perform regression analysis using python.The analysis was performed on the brain weight and the head size of different indivudals. 

## ANALYSIS
- The regression analysis was performed to find the relation between the Brain weight and the head size of the individuals. 
- From the data set, the analysis was performed for 277 different individuals with different head weight and brain sizes. 
- Using the data, regression analysis was performed using the formula as shown in the code.

## Observation
- To determine the goodness of fit, post the analysis, this can be done when a model fits the data well if the differences between the observed values and the model's predicted values are small and unbiased.
- To identify the goodness of fit, R2 method was used. R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression.
-The higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data.
